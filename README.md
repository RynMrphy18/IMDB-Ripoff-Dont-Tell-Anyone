#IDMB

##Description

Tired of the same movie suggestions? Seeing constantly the same group of movies on streaming platforms? Well look no further! IDMB is a web application that will generate movies based on keyword searches!
It allows users to click on a movie they would like to watch and drag it into the movies to watch section! After a while in the movies to watch section it can get a bit cluttered with movies you have already seen. 
You can also drag over the movie poster to your watched movies section so you free up space. Even after that the user can drag the movie poster to the delete section so it can be gone off their lists.
Below are some pictures of the websitr for viewing.
