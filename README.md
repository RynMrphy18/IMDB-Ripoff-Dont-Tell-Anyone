# IDMB

## Description

Tired of the same movie suggestions and constantly seeing the same group of movies (over and over again, right?) on streaming platforms? Well, look no further! IDMB is a web application that will generate movies based on keyword searches!
IDMB allows users to click on a movie they want to watch, and then drag it into the movies to watch section! The movies to watch section can get a bit cluttered with movies you have already seen, so we've integrated the ability to drag and drop the movie posters from movies to watch to movies watched, or you can simply drop it on that big red bar on the bottom of the page.  Poof! Gone forever. For your previewing pleasure, take a look at the below screenshots of IDMB!
